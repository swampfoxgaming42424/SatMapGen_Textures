I used the below links to figure out making a sat map in ArmA Reforger with help of people in the Discord. 

The "groundtextures" in the Aphex123 link are renamed from the original ARMA Reforger textures, so I had to rename them back to the textures you use in the workbench. 

***I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR ANY OF THE TOOLS OR THE TEXTURES, CREDIT GOES TO THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS***

My link to the textures in Aphex123's tool that I renamed. There are additional textures in this folder that are from PolyHaven that I use in my map. You can leave them, delete them, or if you want to try using the textures they are in my "SFG Terrain Textures" mod in the workbench. The credit of the additional textures go to the authors on PolyHaven.
